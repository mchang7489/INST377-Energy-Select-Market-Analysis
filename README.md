# INST377-Energy-Select-Market-Analysis

Abstract:

Energy Select is a growing Solar Energy company in Maryland. Energy Select is a full-service energy consultant and contractor. They provide solar panel installation, energy audits, lighting retrofits, and other money-saving services for both residential and commercial customers. Energy Select specializes in looking at the bigger picture when it comes to providing the best energy solution with a balanced effort of energy conservation and clean energy production. Looking at the cost of electricity rising in Maryland on average 4% per year since 2001, a 2020-expiring 26% federal solar tax credit, and a $1,000 Maryland homeowner solar grant, Energy Select is looking to help people go green and save money in their future. The company’s approach is centered around the consumer’s return investment. To them, reputation matters the most!

As a local solar company, they are committed to providing the best solar service possible to their customers. Energy Select wants to grow their industry and create more connections as they attempt to expand around Maryland. The company has mainly focused their marketing efforts in Southern Maryland but hope to expand into Western Maryland, Prince George’s County, and eventually become state wide and expand into commercial solar. They plan on conducting research in order to find the correct matches for potential buyers of solar products. This will be done by exploring different age groups as well as economical status to see which families in different parts of Maryland would potentially be willing to join the Solar Power Family. From there, the team can help them create methods to reach out to these customers and help their company grow as they expand further into Maryland.
